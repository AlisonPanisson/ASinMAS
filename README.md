# An Argumentation-Scheme-Centred Argumentation Framework in Multi-Agent Systems

This project aims to develop an argumentation framework in which Argumentation Schemes are the core component. 

## Running the Framework

This tutorial is based on JaCaMo Eclipse Plugin. More information about JaCaMo is available [here](http://jacamo.sourceforge.net/).
Also, you need to be familiar with [Jason](http://jason.sourceforge.net/wp/) agent-oriented programming language.

### Installing JaCaMo Eclipse Plugin
- [Install Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
- Install JaCaMo plugin following the instruction in this [link](http://jacamo.sourceforge.net/eclipseplugin/tutorial/)
- Import the [ASinMAS Project](https://github.com/AlisonPanisson/ASinMAS)

## Demonstration

A demonstration of our framework is presented -> [here](https://github.com/AlisonPanisson/ASinMAS/blob/main/demonstration.md)

This demonstration is based on the *Argumentation Scheme from Role to Know* published in [1-4]. 

## Empirical Evaluation

An evaluation of our framework is available -> [here](https://github.com/AlisonPanisson/ASinMAS/blob/main/evaluation.md)
